You will need to download the PanImmune gene set definitions from the Thorsson et al. (2017) Immune landscape of cancer paper (https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/data/9b174979-fe97-48bc-9e97-9384b0519f03) and place them in the Data folder. Datasets will need to be downloaded individually from GEO. The full object generated with the code is available on Synapse.
